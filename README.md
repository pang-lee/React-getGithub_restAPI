# React-getGithub_restAPI

------  Brief description about this application
## Functionality
A React application that can get Github user information by inputing the user Github URL at first page

## how the application be build
In the folder src/
we using the material UI as our frontend template and we organize several component which is:
header.js - which is the websit header
content.js - which is the center part of website content
paperbase.js - which is the websit UI outline (It's import that the whole website outline is at this file - including the header and content component)
repo.js - which is the each github repository page information

----------------------------------------------------------------

Inside App.js we define three react route to different page
I didn't use the Redux instead a global variable
I defined a function call getGithub within serveral function:
getting user data from API with limit 10 record per request

----------------------------------------------------------------

If we want to get more data while we scroll down
check out the content.js
we define a function call fetchMoreData and It'll get more data after scroll down and with simple detection about the record of the repository

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
